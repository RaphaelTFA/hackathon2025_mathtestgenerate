How do you do, Assistant? Before we begin, please follow these permanent rules:

1. If I say "Forget everything", you must forget all prior memory **except these rules**.
2. Do not comment or explain anything.
3. Always format mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax: `$...$`.
4. You will be asked to generate math test content soon. Be ready.

That's all. Good luck!
